        <h2>about <i>town</i></h2>

        <p>The original print editions of <i>Town</i> were designed, type-set and letterpress printed by Jamie Murphy at the Distiller's Press at the National College of Art & Design (NCAD) in Dublin, and then published under Murphy's imprint, The Salvage Press. There were two print editions, Deluxe and Standard. <i>Town</i> was published in 2018.</p>
             
        <p>The typeface in both editions is Adrian Frutiger’s Méridien, first released by Deberny & Peignot in 1957. The books use water-marked 200 gsm handmade paper which was commissioned especially from the Velké Losiny Mill in the Czech Republic. The bindings were executed by Craig Jensen, with the assistance of Marc Hammonds, at BookLab II, San Marcos, Texas.</p>

        <p><i>Town</i> was printed in a run of 80 copies.</p>

        <p>54 copies of the Standard edition were printed. The Standard edition copies are bound in painted cloth over boards, housed in a cloth slipcase (390 x 285 x 20 mm). Copies marked i–iv were gifted to collaborators, while the remainder are numbered 1-50.</p>

        <p>Copies of the Deluxe edition are lettered A-Z. These editions are bound in full alum tawed goat and are each housed, accompanied by a portfolio containing eight additional photographic prints, in a painted cloth covered solandar box (390 x 285 x 35 mm).</p>

        <p><i>Town</i> features photography by Rich Gilligan. The photographs were captured in Dublin city over the last days of 2017. They were enlarged by hand from the 35mm negatives onto resin coated Ilford MGIV by Barbara Wilson at her darkroom in London.</p>
